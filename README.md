> **`python_debugger`** is a zero-dependency, drop-in Python decorator that enables interactive, GDB-style debugging sessions within any function or method. Its terminal-based interface provides powerful breakpoint management, variable inspection, stack navigation, and advanced stepping controls, all with intuitive, colorful prompts.

---

## üöÄ Features

-   **Decorate Any Function/Method**  
    Debug only what you care about ‚Äî just add `@debug_function`.
-   **GDB-Inspired Command-Line Interface**  
    Step, continue, break, backtrace, watch, inspect, and modify ‚Äî interactively.
-   **Breakpoint Power**
    -   Set by line number, function name, or with conditions.
    -   Ignore counts, enable/disable, and clear breakpoints flexibly.
-   **AST-Aided Function Navigation**  
    Break by function names (even inside classes or nested scopes).
-   **Full Stack Introspection**  
    Move up and down the call stack; inspect and modify any frame.
-   **Live Variable Editing**  
    Evaluate and set variables directly in the debugger.
-   **Watched Expressions**  
    Track changing variables or expressions as you step.
-   **Exception Interception**  
    Automatically drops you into the debugger at exceptions.
-   **No External Dependencies**  
    Pure standard library ‚Äî plug and play.

## üì¶ Installation

Just copy [`python_debugger.py`](./python_debugger.py) into your project ‚Äî no pip required.

---

## üìù Usage

### 1. Decorate Your Function

```python
from python_debugger import debug_function

@debug_function
def my_function(x, y):
    total = x + y
    for i in range(5):
        total *= i
    return total
```

### 2. Call as Usual

```python
result = my_function(2, 3)
```

On entry, you'll drop into an interactive debugging session **at the first line** of the decorated function.

## üåà Terminal Output

-   Colorful, clear line markers and stack traces
-   Contextual prompts showing file, line, and function
-   Intuitive watched variable displays
-   Error messages highlighted for visibility

---

## üí° Examples

#### Breakpoints by Function Name

```python
b my_function      # At function start
b MyClass.method   # For methods inside classes
```

#### Conditional Breakpoints

```python
b 27 if x > 5
```

#### Watching Expressions

```python
watch total
watch mylist[-1]
```

#### Modifying Variables on the Fly

```python
set count = 42
```

---

## üß© Integration

-   Works with **any** Python 3.7+ codebase
-   No special environment needed (Unix, Windows, macOS)
-   Decorate multiple functions for targeted debugging
-   Can be used inside Jupyter (though CLI interface is terminal-based)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Reference

### `@debug_function`

-   Decorator for functions/methods
-   **Entry triggers debugger** before first line
-   Exits debugger on function return or `quit`

### Advanced: Programmatic Entry

You may invoke the debugger manually for advanced control (see source code for details).

---

## üß™ Testing

```bash
python -m python_debugger   # (if you provide a test harness)
```

Or add the decorator to your own functions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

-   If the debugger doesn't start:  
    Ensure you called a function decorated with `@debug_function`.
-   If running inside an IDE:  
    For best results, use a standard terminal.
